USER GUIDE: MODIFYING FILES FOR NEW FOLDERS AND VALUES
========================================================

This guide explains what files need to be checked and modified when you want to 
use this renaming script with a new folder structure and different values.

CRITICAL FILES TO MODIFY:
========================

1. rename_files.py (PRIMARY FILE - MUST MODIFY)
2. rename_files_explanation.txt (Documentation updates)
3. README.md (Project documentation updates)

DETAILED MODIFICATION GUIDE:
===========================

FILE 1: rename_files.py
-----------------------

This is the main script that contains all the logic. You MUST modify these sections:

A) HARDCODED PARAMETERS (Lines 7-8):
   Current values:
   edit_id = "rvn001"        ← CHANGE THIS
   code = "00W5"             ← CHANGE THIS
   
   Example new values:
   edit_id = "rvn002"        (for a new edit)
   code = "00W6"             (for a new code)

B) SUFFIX MAPPING (Lines 10-15):
   Current mapping:
   suffix_mapping = {
       "Eligiable": "posi",   ← MAY NEED TO CHANGE
       "bypass": "nega",      ← MAY NEED TO CHANGE
       "market": "ex",        ← MAY NEED TO CHANGE
       "dos": "ex"            ← MAY NEED TO CHANGE
   }
   
   Only change this if your files use different suffix values!

C) DIRECTORY PATHS (Lines 17-18):
   Current paths:
   source_dir = "TS_01_REVENUE_WGS_CSBD_rvn001_00W5_payloads/smoke"
   dest_dir = r"C:\Users\Vishnu\Cursor_AI_proj\GIT_HUB\renaming_files\renaming_jsons\TS_01_REVENUE_WGS_CSBD_rvn001_00W5_payloads\smoke"
   
   You MUST change both paths to match your new folder structure!

FILE 2: rename_files_explanation.txt
-----------------------------------

Update this documentation file to reflect:
- New parameter values
- New examples
- New naming patterns
- Updated summary section

FILE 3: README.md
-----------------

Update the project documentation to include:
- New project description
- New usage examples
- New folder structure information

STEP-BY-STEP MODIFICATION PROCESS:
================================

1. IDENTIFY YOUR NEW VALUES:
   - What is your new edit_id? (e.g., "rvn002", "rvn003")
   - What is your new code? (e.g., "00W6", "00W7")
   - What is your new folder name?

2. MODIFY rename_files.py:
   - Change edit_id value
   - Change code value
   - Change source_dir path
   - Change dest_dir path
   - Update suffix_mapping if needed

3. UPDATE DOCUMENTATION:
   - Modify rename_files_explanation.txt
   - Modify README.md

4. TEST YOUR CHANGES:
   - Run the script to ensure it works
   - Check that files are renamed correctly
   - Verify destination folder structure

EXAMPLE: CHANGING TO NEW FOLDER STRUCTURE
=========================================

Let's say you want to use:
- New edit_id: "rvn002"
- New code: "00W6"
- New folder: "TS_02_PAYMENT_WGS_CSBD_rvn002_00W6_payloads"

CHANGES NEEDED IN rename_files.py:

OLD VALUES:
edit_id = "rvn001"
code = "00W5"
source_dir = "TS_01_REVENUE_WGS_CSBD_rvn001_00W5_payloads/smoke"
dest_dir = r"C:\Users\Vishnu\Cursor_AI_proj\GIT_HUB\renaming_files\renaming_jsons\TS_01_REVENUE_WGS_CSBD_rvn001_00W5_payloads\smoke"

NEW VALUES:
edit_id = "rvn002"
code = "00W6"
source_dir = "TS_02_PAYMENT_WGS_CSBD_rvn002_00W6_payloads/smoke"
dest_dir = r"C:\Users\Vishnu\Cursor_AI_proj\GIT_HUB\renaming_files\renaming_jsons\TS_02_PAYMENT_WGS_CSBD_rvn002_00W6_payloads\smoke"

FILE NAMING PATTERN:
===================

The script transforms files from:
OLD FORMAT: TC_01#Eligiable.json
NEW FORMAT: TC_01#Eligiable#rvn002#00W6#posi.json

Where:
- TC_01: Test case identifier
- Eligiable: Original suffix
- rvn002: Your new edit_id
- 00W6: Your new code
- posi: Mapped suffix (from suffix_mapping)

IMPORTANT NOTES:
===============

1. The script expects source files to have exactly 2 parts separated by '#'
2. Make sure your destination directory path is correct and accessible
3. The script will create the destination directory if it doesn't exist
4. Original files are removed after successful copying
5. Only JSON files are processed

TROUBLESHOOTING:
================

Common issues and solutions:

1. "Source directory not found" error:
   - Check that source_dir path is correct
   - Ensure the folder actually exists

2. Permission errors:
   - Check that you have write access to destination directory
   - Ensure source files aren't read-only

3. File format errors:
   - Ensure your source files follow the expected format: TC_XX#suffix.json
   - Check that files have exactly 2 parts separated by '#'

4. Destination path issues:
   - Use raw string (r"path") for Windows paths
   - Ensure the full path is correct

Remember: Always test with a small set of files first before running on your entire folder!
